## Flavor Profile

Japanese cuisine emphasizes **freshness, seasonality, and subtle flavors**. It focuses on bringing out the natural taste of ingredients rather than heavy sauces or spices.

Key elements include **umami** (from soy sauce, miso, dashi), **delicate preparation**, and **beautiful presentation**. Rice and fish are central to most meals.
