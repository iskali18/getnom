## Flavor Profile

Thai cuisine is built around the balance of **four core flavors**: sweet, sour, salty, and spicy. Almost every dish plays with this harmony using ingredients like fish sauce, lime, palm sugar, and chilies.

The cuisine emphasizes **fresh herbs** (basil, cilantro, mint), **aromatics** (lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime), and **coconut milk** in many dishes.
