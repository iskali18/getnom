# Curries Around the World

“Curry” can mean a creamy coconut sauce, a tomato-based stew, a dry spice blend, or something fiery and peppery. This page helps you recognize what you’re getting—before you order.

---

## What “curry” usually means

- **Creamy & coconut-based:** often Southeast Asian (Thai, some South Indian dishes)
- **Tomato & onion base:** common in North Indian and many restaurant-style curries
- **Dry curry:** “dry-fried” or “stir-fried” curries with less sauce (very common in parts of India)
- **Spice-forward & stew-like:** can be hearty, aromatic, and sometimes spicy

---

## Beginner
Great if you want mild-to-medium heat and familiar flavors.

- **Butter Chicken (India)** – creamy, tomato-forward, usually mild  
- **Korma (India/Pakistan)** – nutty, creamy, gentle spice  
- **Japanese Curry** – thick, slightly sweet, comfort-food vibes  

---

## Intermediate
More aromatics, more herbs/spices, and sometimes more heat.

- **Green Curry (Thailand)** – herbaceous, coconut, can be spicy  
- **Massaman Curry (Thailand)** – warm spices + coconut, often mild-medium  
- **Rogan Josh (Kashmiri-style)** – deeper spice flavor, richer body  

---

## Advanced
For stronger heat, funkier fermented notes, or very distinct spice profiles.

- **Vindaloo** – tangy + spicy (varies a lot by restaurant)  
- **Fish Curry** – bolder flavor and aroma  
- **Dry Chili Curry / Peppery Curries** – intense spice-forward styles  

---

## Quick ordering tips
- If you want **mild**, ask for mild *and* choose creamy options (korma, butter chicken, massaman).
- If you want **aromatic**, choose herb-forward curries (green curry) or long-simmered styles.
- If you’re unsure about heat, ask: “Is this spicy-spicy, or flavor-spicy?”
