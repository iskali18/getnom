# Noodles & Pasta

Noodles are all about texture. Some are chewy and springy, some are silky, some are wide and slippery. Once you know the “type,” ordering gets easy.

---

## What to notice first
- **Thickness:** thin = lighter, thick = chewier
- **Sauce:** broth-based vs stir-fried vs saucy
- **Heat:** some noodles are mild, others are chili-forward

---

## Beginner
Approachable flavors and usually easy heat control.

- **Pad Thai (Thailand)** – sweet/sour/savory, peanut + lime  
- **Yakitori/Udon (Japan)** – mild, comforting broth noodles  
- **Pho (Vietnam)** – fragrant broth, customizable with herbs  

---

## Intermediate
Bigger sauces, more aromatics, sometimes more spice.

- **Pad See Ew (Thailand)** – wide noodles, soy-based, savory  
- **Drunken Noodles / Pad Kee Mao (Thailand)** – basil + chili + heat potential  
- **Ramen (Japan)** – richer broth, deeper flavor, lots of variations  

---

## Advanced
Bold funk, strong chili, or very specific textures.

- **Bún Bò Huế (Vietnam)** – spicy, aromatic, intense broth  
- **Dan Dan–style noodles** – chili + numbing spice (varies by restaurant)  
- **Fermented or seafood-forward noodle dishes** – stronger aroma/flavor

---

## Quick ordering tips
- Want **mild**? Choose broth noodles and add spice later.
- Want **chewy**? Ask for thick noodles (udon) or wide rice noodles.
- Not sure? Ask: “Is this more sweet/savory, or spicy?”
