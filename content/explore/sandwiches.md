# Sandwiches Worldwide

Sandwiches are a perfect “gateway food” because they’re familiar, but every culture has its own rules—bread, sauces, fillings, and how messy it’s supposed to be.

---

## What to notice first
- **Bread style:** soft, crusty, flatbread, or toasted
- **Sauce level:** dry, lightly dressed, or fully sauced
- **Heat:** pickled peppers and chili sauces can sneak up on you

---

## Beginner
Familiar structure, easy flavors.

- **Torta (Mexico)** – big, layered, very customizable  
- **Chicken shawarma wrap** – savory, mild-to-medium spice  
- **Grilled cheese–style melts** – comfort food anywhere  

---

## Intermediate
More sauces, tang, or spice.

- **Bánh mì (Vietnam)** – crisp bread + pickled veg + sauces  
- **Cubano-style sandwiches** – layered, pressed, tangy/savory  
- **Spicy chicken sandwiches** – heat levels vary wildly  

---

## Advanced
Bold sauces, strong pickles/ferments, or extra spicy builds.

- **Chili-sauce heavy sandwiches**  
- **Strong fermented/pickled components**  
- **“Everything” sandwiches** where the sauce is the main event  

---

## Quick ordering tips
- If you don’t like heat, ask for sauces **on the side**.
- If you’re unsure, pick a sandwich with **fresh + crunchy** components (often easier).
