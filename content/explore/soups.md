# Soups & Stews

Soups are one of the easiest ways to explore a cuisine—because you can usually spot the vibe: light and brothy, rich and creamy, or hearty like a stew.

---

## The four soup “vibes”
- **Clear & brothy:** lighter, aromatic, customizable
- **Creamy:** rich, comforting, often mild
- **Spicy & sour:** bold, bright, wake-you-up flavors
- **Hearty stew:** filling, slow-cooked, deep flavor

---

## Beginner
Comfort-food soups that are usually low-risk.

- **Chicken noodle–style soups** – familiar and mild  
- **Miso soup (Japan)** – savory, light, simple  
- **Tortilla soup (Mexico)** – hearty, customizable heat  

---

## Intermediate
More aromatics and layered flavors.

- **Pho (Vietnam)** – fragrant broth + herbs  
- **Tom Kha (Thailand)** – coconut + lime + ginger notes  
- **Pozole (Mexico)** – rich stew texture, toppings matter  

---

## Advanced
Spicier, funkier, or more intense sour/fermented flavors.

- **Tom Yum (Thailand)** – spicy-sour and aromatic  
- **Bún Bò Huế (Vietnam)** – bold, spicy, very distinct  
- **Hot & sour styles** – tangy + peppery, big flavor

## Quick ordering tips
- If you’re cautious: start with **brothy or creamy** soups.
- Ask: “Is this **spicy-spicy** or just flavorful?”
- Don’t skip toppings—herbs, lime, crunch, and sauces are often the point.
